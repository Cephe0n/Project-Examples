## About the projects

All the example projects listed here are ones where I was the only coder involved.

### Mechalon VR

    Mechalon was an ambitious project with a deadline of only 12 weeks.
    It is a VR mech arena combat game, complete with buyable upgrades and progression,
    multiple weapons, AI and locational damage.
    It works on both HTC Vive and Oculus and was created using the VRTK plugin.
    
### Thrust Issues

    Thrust Issues is a WIP VR anti-gravity racing game.
    Current features include a drivable ship with a unique, made-for-vr dual throttle control system,
    A stick shift and boost system, as well as a "wall of death" the player races against.
    It is tested to be working on Valve Index, HTC Vive and Oculus systems.
    It was made using the SteamVR Unity plugin.
    
### Craftwerk Corps

    A game jam game, made in less than 48 hours. A VR game about fixing broken zombies in a factory.
    It includes teleport movement, spawning zombies and bodyparts from the players input, 
    attachable bodyparts, a hammer which fixes them in place, a score system and a timer.
    
    
### SnoVR

    Another game jam game with a deadline of 48 hours. It is a VR snowfight game.
    Included mechanics are spawning and throwing snowballs, two gamemodes, one with
    physics-enabled snowmen to practice on, another where you try to hit an AI opponent three times before he hits you.
